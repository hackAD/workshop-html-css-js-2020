# HTML, CSS,  and JScript workshop
This readme is for the workshop that happened on Mar 3 2020, hosted by Filip.



## Files

The repo has no files since we really didn't do much except for demonstrations. Please head to bendevski/commLabWhat in order to see the project that was presented.

## HTML

HTML is the base building block of websites. No matter what you do, in the end you have to have HTML in order to have a website. How it is generated though, is largely up to the developer. HTML is not a programming language, instead it is a markup language. The difference being that HTML does not incorporate logic, instead it is just a way to write things so that they look a specific way.

## CSS

If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin. CSS is what we use to make websites look nice. It is what we use to add colors and to make site actually look like sites instead of text documents. It is very rare (if not impossible) to find a framework that does not use CSS. CSS has also grown in popularity outside of websites, being used by android apps, as well as inside of apps themselves, such as with Anki, the flashcard app.

## JScript

Going forward with the body metaphor JScript would be the muscles. JavaScript adds spice to our website, making it, here comes the buzzword, responsive!!! There are a lot of cool ways to utilize JavaScript, and with the advent of Node as a runtime environment, the use cases show no sign of lessening.

 really cool article, let's you ease into the confusion that frameworks present

## Sass

Think CSS with variables and logic. Let's us write CSS in a more... programatic way, and then compile it into base CSS.
